# Pronance Protocol
Pronance contract is a mixture of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. First, the dev has minted the tokens - sent the balance to DxSale for fair launch - and then burned the remainder of the tokens. Dev had to partake in presale. Second, utilized the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for whole year. Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project. 100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible. #pronance join us on our journey safely to the moon!
